<h4>To save time and memory.</h4>
• Time is precious.<br>
• Memory is expensive.
</p>
<br>
<h2 align='center'>Why should we learn DSA?</h2>
<p>
• DSA helps in improving the Problem Solving Skills.<br>
• It helps in picking out an Algorithm that can Solve Real-life Problems easily.<br>
• More than 70 % Companies ask DSA Problems in their Interview Process.<br>
• Many Online Competitions are organised to Test Problem Solving skills. Eg :- TCS Codevita, Amazon WOW.<br>
