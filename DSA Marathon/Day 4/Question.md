For example, “act” and “tac” are an anagram of each other.

### Input :

The first line of the input contains an integer `T`, denoting the total number of `test cases`. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. First line of each test case contains a String `a` and Second line contains a String `b`.

### Output :

Print `YES` if the given strings are `anagram` else print `NO`.

### Constraints :

```
